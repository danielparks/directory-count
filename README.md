# Recursively count the contents of directories recursively

Think `du`, but it counts directory entries, e.g. files, directories, symlinks,
instead of the size of files.

### Example

```
❯ directory_count /etc/ssh
     1 /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d
     2 /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d
     7 /etc/ssh
❯ tree -F /etc/ssh
/etc/ssh/
├── moduli
├── ssh_config
├── ssh_config.d/
├── sshd_config
└── sshd_config.d/
    └── 100-macos.conf

3 directories, 4 files
```
